# Customising Log Outputs

To customise the logs, you can add a **helper text** to help you describe what kind of logs it is eg the type of data, as well as **colors** to style the logs according to your preferences, eg **red** for logging errors

**_Import statement:_**

```typescript
import { println } from "js-logs-formatter";
```

We will be using the same sample data that was used in the [Basic Usage](usage#sample-data) section.

```typescript
println({
  helper: "User Data",
  data: user,
  color: "green",
});
```

This will print out the user data to the console and the logs will alsoinclude the function name and line number hat the `println` function was called.

**Output:**

<pre
  style={{
    color: "#00FF00",
  }}
>
  User Data (called from function: yourFunctionName at line yourLineNumber)
  {`
  {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "age": 28,
    "active": false,
    "email": "janedoe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "state": "CA",
      "zipCode": "12345"
    },
    "preferences": {
      "newsletter": true,
      "notifications": {
        "email": true,
        "sms": false
      }
    },
    "createdAt": "2022-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "lastLogin": "2023-09-28T10:00:00Z",
    "roles": [
      "user",
      "admin"
    ],
    "points": 1500
  }
  `}
</pre>

**_Note:_** Due to differences in how React Native handles stack traces, the accuracy of line numbers and function names can vary. While the `println` function captures file names and line numbers accurately in Node.js environments, in React Native, the stack trace format may include network-related information or different formatting, making line numbers less predictable. For best results, focus on the file name and function name when using this in a React Native environment.

We can use the **red** colors (background colors included) to easily identify error logs:

```typescript
try {
  loginUser();
} catch (error) {
  println({
    helper: "loginUser error",
    data: error.response.data.message,
    color: "red",
  });
}
```

**Output:**

<pre style={{ color: "#FF6B6B" }}>
  {`
  loginUser error
  { 
    "success": false, 
    "error": "Invalid email or password"
  }
 `}
</pre>

Or using a **red background color**:

```typescript
try {
  loginUser();
} catch (error) {
  println({
    helper: "loginUser error",
    data: error.response.data.message,
    color: "bgRed",
  });
}
```

<pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#FF6F6F", color: "#000000" }}>
  {`
  loginUser error
  { 
    "success": false, 
    "error": "Invalid email or password"
  }
 `}
</pre>
